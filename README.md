# IronSource Interactive video assignment
## Some notes about the implementation :
1. The video appears only if the screen is in landscape mode on phone
2. I used Lottie to create the buttons, as I found those more suited for the project - it remind me a real mobile game buttons!
    - You can find more information about Lottie here : https://lottiefiles.com/
